## 1.0.1 (in progress)

- Fix bug in 1.0.0 release with parallel calculations on whole genome samples.
  The release version only parallelizes by chromosome instead of callable
  regions, resulting in less parallelism. Thanks to Sven-Eric Schelhorn and
  Neill Gibson.
- Generalize use of working directories to support runs on S3 mounted
  filesystems. Ensures all work takes place inside transactional directories.
  Thanks to Tetiana Khotiainsteva and Sven-Eric Schelhorn.
- Provide separate germline calling for somatic tumor/normal pairs. Supplements
  somatic calls with standard germline calls on normal samples, including
  ensemble and SV calling.

  This allows creation of GEMINI output for any organism. Adds support for hg38
  with annotations from dbSNP, Clinvar, ExAC and ESP.
- Support FreeBayes 1.1.0 for improved memory usage and 3-4x speedup.
  Will default to 1.1.0 at next release. Validation work:
  https://github.com/bcbio/bcbio.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2016-11-21-giab-hg38-freebayes.md

  can confuse shell commands.

## 0.9.7 (29 March 2016)

- Use MultiQC (github.com/ewels/MultiQC) as main package to process all
  QC metrics.
- New install procedure for data: `--datatarget` allows installation of sub-sets
  of supplemental data for smaller installs for small RNA only analysis. Also

  data used in the analysis.
- Use sample description for BAM read group IDs, instead of lane index. This
  allows remixing of samples after processing without potential collisions. Thanks
  to Neill Gibson.

- Use new snpEff annotations (ANN) instead of older approach (EFF). The
  new annotations are more interoperable and supported by GEMINI.
- Lazy import of matplotlib libraries to avoid slow startup times.
- Only apply ploidyfix to all female batches to remove Y chromosome. Avoids
  confusion with file produced in other cases without any changes.
- Improvement to bcbio CWL integration: support parallel alignment and variant
  calling.
- Support for Salmon and RapMap added.
- FastRNA-seq pipeline implemented that does nothing but run Salmon with no QC.
- Singlecell RNA-seq pipeline implemented that uses https://github.com/vals/umis
  to handle the UMI and cellular barcode, aligns with RapMap and quantitates
  by counting, scaling ambiguous reads by the number of transcripts they could have
  come from.
- Migrate bowtie and bowtie2 to handle split input alignments, bgzipped inputs,
  and produce sorted, de-duplicated BAM files. This allows use in additional
  standard pipelines. Thanks to Luca Beltrame.
- Switch final upload directories for salmon and sailfish results to be of the
  form samplename/salmon instead of samplename/salmon/samplename.

## 0.9.6 (12 February 2016)

- Installation uses conda packages from bioconda for Python dependencies and
  third party tools.

  a two step process. First `bcbio_nextgen.py upgrade -u stable --tools`
  (or `-u development`) then `bcbio_nextgen.py upgrade --data`.
- Improve de-duplication for split alignments. Do not sort/merge during splits,
  and instead perform a global merge sort and de-duplication of the final set of
  reads.
- Initial support for new human genome build (hg38/GRCh38) including alternative
  alleles. Usage is in place but still requires validation and additional testing.

  family, gender and phenotype information. Any sample rows from PED files get
  used when creating the GEMINI database.
- Fix preparation of multi-allelic inputs to GEMINI by implementing custom merge
  of bi-allelic and split multi-allelic. Previous implementation using GATK
  CombineVariants re-merged some split multi-allelic, losing effects annotations.
- Skip contig order naming checking with bedtools 2.23.0+ to avoid potential
  issues with complex naming schemes.
- Installation and upgrade: Set pip SSL certificates to point at installed conda
  SSL package if present. Avoids SSL errors when pip can't find system
  certificates. Thanks to Andrew Oler.
- Enable support for PBSPro schedulers through ipython-cluster-helper.

- Support snpEff 4.1, including re-download of snpEff databases on demand if out
  of sync with older versions.
- Split multi-allelic variants into bi-allelic calls prior to loading into
  GEMINI, since it only handles bi-allelic inputs. Thanks to PÃ¤r Larsson.
- Pass ploidy to GATK HaplotypeCaller, supporting multiple ploidies and correct
  calling of X/Y/MT chromosomes. Requires GATK 3.3.
- Remove extra 'none' sample when calling tumor-only samples using
  MuTect. Harmonizes headers with other tumor-only callers and enables
  tumor-only ensemble calling. Thanks to Miika Ahdesmaki.
- Perform variant prioritization as part of tumor-only calling, using population
  based frequencies like 1000 genomes and ExAC and presence in known disease
  causing databases like COSMIC and Clinvar.

  files. These are now processed sequentially on a single machine to avoid
  conflicts. Thanks to Justin Johnson.
- Add data checks and improved flexibility when specifying
  joint callers. Thanks to Luca Beltrame.
- Default to a reduced number of split regions (`nomap_split_targets` defaults
  to 200 instead of 2000) to avoid controller memory issues with large sample
  sizes.
- Avoid re-calculating depth metrics when running post variant calling
  annotation with GATK to provide accurate metrics on high depth samples.
  Thanks to Miika Ahdesmaki.
- Consistently keep annotations and genotype information for split MNPs from

  CatVariants. Fall back to bcftools concat which correctly handles problem
  headers and overlapping segments.
- Enable flexible specification of `indelcaller` for `variantcaller` targets
  that do not have integrated indel methods. Thanks to Miika Ahdesmaki.
- Move to samtools 1.0 release. Update samtools variant calling to support new
  multiallelic approach.
- Improve Platypus integration: correctly pass multiple BAM files, make use of
  assembler, split MNPs, and correctly restrict to variant regions.
- Be more aggressive with system memory usage to try and make better use of
  available resources. The hope is to take advantage of Java memory fixes that
  previously forced us to be conservative.

## 0.8.1 (August 29, 2014)
- Support joint recalling with GATK HapolotypeCaller, FreeBayes and Platypus. The
  `jointcaller` configuration variable enables calling concurrently in large
  populations by independently calling on samples them combining into a final
  combined callset with no-call/reference calls at any position called
  independently.
- Add qsignature tool to standard and variant analyses, which helps identify
  sample swaps. Add `mixup_check` configuration variant to enable.

  regions.
- Improved cluster cleanup by providing better error handling and removal of
  controllers and engines in additional failure cases.

  organisms with many chromosomes.
- Initial support for tumor normal calling with VarDict. Thanks to
  Miika Ahdesmaki and Zhongwu Lai.

  using samblaster or biobambam's bammarkduplicates. Removes need for secondary
  split of files and BAM preparation unless recalibration and realignment
  needed. Enables pre-processing of input files for structural variant detection.
- Rework batched regional analysis in variant calling to remove custom cases and
  simplify structure. Filtering now happens explicitly on the combined batch
  file. This is functionally equivalent to previous filters but now the workflow
  is clearer. Avoids special cases for tumor/normal inputs.
- Perform regional splitting of samples grouped by batch instead of globally,
  enabling multiple organisms and experiments within a single input sample YAML.
- Add temporary directory usage to enable use of local high speed scratch disk
  on setups with large enough global temporary storage.
- Update FreeBayes to latest version and provide improved filtering for high
  depth artifacts.

  `--max-bundle-frags` to 2,000,000. Thanks to Miika Ahdesmaki.
- Provide cleaner installation process for non-distributable tools like
  GATK. The `--tooplus` argument now handles jars from the GATK site or Appistry
  and correctly updates manifest version information.

  uncompressed VCFs. Reduces space requirements and enables parallelization on
  non-shared filesystems or temporary space by avoiding transferring
  uncompressed outputs.
- Reduce memory usage during post-alignment BAM preparation steps (PrintReads
  downsampling, deduplication and realignment prep) to avoid reaching memory cap
  on limited systems like SLURM. Do not include for IndelRealigner which needs
  memory in high depth regions.
- Provide explicit targets for coverage depth (`coverage_depth_max` and
  `coverage_depth_min`) instead of `coverage_depth` enumeration. Provide
  downsampling of reads to max depth during post-alignment preparation to avoid
  repetitive centromere regions with high depth.

  Ahdesmaki.
- Fix bug in retrieval of snpEff databases on install. Thanks to Matan Hofree.
- Fix bug in normal BAM preparation for tumor/normal variant calling. Thanks to
  Miika Ahdesmaki.
- General removal of GATK for variant manipulation functionality to help focus
  on support for upcoming GATK 3.0. Use bcftools for splitting of variants into
  SNPs and indels instead of GATK. Use vcflib's vcfintersection to combine SNPs
  and indels instead of GATK. Use bcftools for sample selection from
  multi-sample VCFs. Use pysam for calculation of sample coverage.
- Use GATK 3.0 MIT licensed framework for remaining BAM and variant manipulation
  code (PrintReads, CombineVariants) to provide one consistent up to date set of
  functionality for GATK variant manipulation.
- Normalize input variant_regions BED files to avoid overlapping
  segments. Avoids out of order errors with FreeBayes caller which will call in
  each region without flattening the input BED.
