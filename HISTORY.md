  to samples with input CSV. Includes customization of algorithm section and
  better matching of samples using input file names. Improve ability to
  distinguish fastq pairs.
- Generalize snpEff database preparation to use individual databases located
  with each genome. Enables better multi-organism support.

  in parallel for paired ends.
- Fix downsampling with GATK-lite 2.3.9 releases by moving to sambamba based downsampling.
  Thanks to Przemek Lyszkiewicz.
- Handle Illumina format input files for bwa-mem alignment, and cleanly convert
  these when preparing bgzipped inputs for parallel alignment. Thanks to Miika
  Ahdesmaki.
- Provide better algorithm for distinguishing bwa-mem and bwa-aln usage. Now
  does random sampling of first 2 million reads instead of taking the first set
  of reads which may be non-generalizable. Also lowers requirement to use
  bwa-mem to 75% of reads being smaller than 70bp. Thanks to Paul Tang.
- Enable specification of a GATK key file in the bcbio_system resources
  `keyfile` parameter. Disables callbacks to GATK tracking. Thanks to Severine
  Catreux for keyfile to debug with.

  lightweight QC framework. Prefer better coverage framework moving forward.
- Added extra summary information to the project-summary.yaml file so downstream tools can
  locate what genome resources were used.
- Added ``test_run`` option to the sample configuration file. Set it to True to run a small
subset of your data through the pipeline to make sure everything is working okay.
- Fusion support added by setting ``fusion_mode: True`` in the algorithim section.
Not officially documented for now until we can come up with best practices for it.

- Fixed issue with the complexity calculation throwing an exception when there
were not enough reads.
- Add disambiguation stats to final project-summary.yaml file. Thanks to Miika Ahdesmaki.
- Remove `Estimated Library Size` and `Complexity` from RNA-seq QC
summary information as they were confusing and unnecessarily alarming,
respectively. Thanks to Miika Ahdesmaki and Sara Dempster.
- Several memory allocation errors resulting in jobs getting killed in
cluster environments for overusing their memory limit fixed.
- Added JVM options by default to Picard to allocate enough memory
for large BAM->FastQ conversion.

## 0.7.5 (November 29, 2013)

  code, tools and data. Now each require an implicit specification, while other
  options are remembered. Thanks to Jakub Nowacki.
- Generalize retrieval of RNA-seq resources (GTF files, transcriptome indexes) to use
  genome-resources.yaml. Updates all genome resources files. Contributed by James Porter.
- Use sambamba for indexing, which allows multicore indexing to speed up index
  creation on large BAM processing. Falls back to samtools index if not available.
- Remove custom Picard metrics runs and pdf generation. Eliminates dependencies on
  pdflatex and R for QC metrics.
- Improve memory handling by providing fallbacks during common memory intensive steps.
  Better handle memory on SLURM by explicitly allowing system memory in addition
  to that required for processing.
- Update fastqc runs to use a BAM files downsampled to 10 million reads to avoid
  excessive run times. Part of general speed up of QC step.

- Fix for crash with single-end reads in read_through trimming.
- Added a library complexity calculation for RNA-seq libraries as a QC metric
- Added sorting via sambamba. Internally bcbio-nextgen now inspects the headers
  of SAM/BAM files to find their sorting status, so make sure tools set it correctly.

  redirect to `variant2`.
- Improve parallelization of BAM preparation and gemini database creation by
  moving to multicore versions.
- Move variant annotation to work on called sub-regions, to avoid bottlenecks
  when annotating a full whole genome VCF.
- Remove sequencer-specific integration functionality which is poorly maintained
  and better done with third party tools: demultiplexing and statistics from
  Illumina directories.
- Bug fix to re-enable template generation functionality.

  Beltrame.
- Generalize variant calling to support alternative callers like cancer-specific
  calling: provide additional associated files to variant calls and pass along
  sample specific metadata. Document implementation of new variant callers.
