A python toolkit providing best-practice pipelines for fully automated high throughput sequencing analysis. You write a high level configuration file specifying your inputs and analysis parameters. This input drives a parallel pipeline that handles distributed execution, idempotent processing restarts and safe transactional steps. The goal is to provide a shared community resource that handles the data processing component of sequencing analysis, providing researchers with more time to focus on the downstream biology.
