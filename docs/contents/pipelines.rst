Variant calling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

bcbio-nextgen implements configurable best-practice pipelines for SNP
and small indel calling:

-  Sequence alignment:

   - `bwa mem`_
   - `novoalign`_
   - `bowtie2`_
   - `mosaik`_

-  Base Quality Recalibration
-  Realignment around indels
-  Variant calling:

   -  `GATK Unified Genotyper`_ (supports both GATK-lite in GATK 2.3
      and commercial restricted version in GATK 2.4+)
   -  `GATK Haplotype caller`_ (part of the commercially restricted GATK 2.4+)
   -  `FreeBayes`_
   -  `samtools mpileup`_
   -  `cortex\_var`_
   -  `VarScan`_

-  Paired tumor / normal variant calling:

   - `MuTect`_ (version 1.1.5 and above)
   - `VarScan`_

-  Quality filtering, using either
   `GATK's Variant Quality Score Recalibrator`_ or hard filtering.
-  Annotation of variant effects, using `snpEff`_
-  Variant exploration and prioritization, using `GEMINI`_

It follows approaches from:

- `GATK best practice`_ guidelines for variant calling
- Marth Lab's `gkno pipelines`_


RNA-seq
~~~~~~~

bcbio-nextgen also implements a configurable best-practice pipeline for RNA-seq
quality control, adapter trimming, alignment and post-alignment quantitation

- Adapter trimming:
  - `cutadapt`_

- Sequence alignment:
  - `tophat2`_
  - `STAR`_

- Quality control:
  - `RNA-SeQC`_
  - `FastQC`_

- Quantitation:
  - `HTSeq`_

Configuration
=============
We will assume that you installed bcbio-nextgen with the automated installer,
and so your default `bcbio_system.yaml`_ file is configured correctly with all
of the tools pointing to the right places. If that is the case to run
bcbio-nextgen on a set of samples you just need to set up a YAML file that
describes your samples and what you would like to do to them. Let's say that you
have a single paired-end control lane, prepared with the Illumina `TruSeq`_ Kit
from a human. Here is what a well-formed sample YAML file for that RNA-seq
experiment would look like::

    fc_date: '070113'
    fc_name: control_experiment
    upload:
      dir: final
    details:
      - files: [/full/path/to/control_1.fastq, /full/path/to/control_2.fastq]
	description: 'Control_rep1'
	genome_build: GRCh37
	analysis: RNA-seq
	algorithm:
	     quality_format: Standard
	     trim_reads: read_through
	     adapters: [truseq, polya]

``fc_date`` and ``fc_name`` will be combined to form a prefix to name
intermediate files, you can set them to whatever you like.  ``upload`` is
explained pretty well in the `configuration documentation`_ and the above will
direct bcbio-nextgen to put the output files from the pipeine into the ``final``
directory.  Under ``details`` is a list of sections each describing a sample to
process.  You can set a great many `parameters`_ under each section but most of
the time just setting a few like the above is all that is necessary.
``analysis`` tells bcbio-nextgen to run the best-practice RNA-seq pipeline on
this sample.

In the above, since there are two files, ``control_1.fastq`` and
``control_2.fastq`` will be automatically run as paired-end data. If you have
single end data you can just supply one file and it will run as single-end. The
``description`` field will be used to eventually rename the files, so make it
very evocative since you will be looking at it a lot later. ``genome_build`` is
self-explanatory.

Sometimes you need a little bit more flexibility than the standard pipeline, and
the ``algorithm`` section has many options to fine-tune the behavior of the
algorithm. ``quality_format`` tells bcbio-nextgen what quality format your FASTQ
inputs are using, if your samples were sequenced any time past 2009 or so, you
probably want to set it to ``Standard``. Adapter read-through is a problem in
RNA-seq libraries, so we want to trim off possible adapter sequences on the ends
of reads, so ``trim_reads`` is set to ``read_through``, which will also trim off
poor quality ends. Since your library is a RNA-seq library prepared with the
TruSeq kit, the set of adapters to trim off are the TruSeq adapters and possible
polyA tails, so ``adapters`` is set to the both of those.

Multiple samples
================
Lets say you have a set of mouse samples to analyze and each sample is a single
lane of single-end RNA-seq reads prepared using the NextEra kit.  There are
two case and two control samples. Here is a
sample configuration file for that analysis::

    fc_date: '070113'
    fc_name: mouse_analysis
    upload:
      dir: final
    details:
      - files: [/full/path/to/control_rep1.fastq]
	description: 'Control_rep1'
	genome_build: GRCm38
	analysis: RNA-seq
	algorithm:
	     quality_format: Standard
	     trim_reads: read_through
	     adapters: [nextera, polya]
      - files: [/full/path/to/control_rep2.fastq]
	description: 'Control_rep2'
	genome_build: GRCm38
	analysis: RNA-seq
	algorithm:
	     quality_format: Standard
	     trim_reads: read_through
	     adapters: [nextera, polya]
      - files: [/full/path/to/case_rep1.fastq]
	description: 'Case_rep1'
	genome_build: GRCm38
	analysis: RNA-seq
	algorithm:
	     quality_format: Standard
	     trim_reads: read_through
	     adapters: [nextera, polya]
      - files: [/full/path/to/case_rep2.fastq]
	description: 'Case_rep2'
	genome_build: GRCm38
	analysis: RNA-seq
	algorithm:
	     quality_format: Standard
	     trim_reads: read_through
	     adapters: [nextera, polya]

More samples are added just by adding more entries under the details section.
This is tedious and error prone to do by hand, so there is an automated
`template_` system for common experiments. You could set up the previous
experiment by making a mouse version of the `illumina-rnaseq`_ template
file and saving it to a local file such as ``illumina-mouse-rnaseq.yaml``. Then
you can set up the sample file using the templating system::

    bcbio_nextgen.py -w template illumina-mouse-rnaseq.yaml mouse_analysis
    /full/path/to/control_rep1.fastq /full/path/to/control_rep2.fastq
    /full/path/to/case_rep1.fastq /full/path/to/case_rep2.fastq


If you had paired-end samples instead of single-end samples, you can still use
the template system as long as you the forward and reverse read filenames are
the same, barring a _1 and _2. For example: control_1.fastq and control_2.fastq
will be detected as paired and combined in the YAML file output by the
templating system.
