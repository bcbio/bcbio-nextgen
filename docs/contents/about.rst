Introduction
------------

bcbio-nextgen provides best-practice pipelines for automated analysis
of high throughput sequencing data with the goal of being:

- Quantifiable: Doing good science requires being able to accurately
  assess the quality of results and re-verify approaches as new
  algorithms and software become available.

- Analyzable: Results feed into tools to make it easy to query and
  visualize the results.

- Scalable: Handle large datasets and sample populations on distributed
  heterogeneous compute environments.

- Reproducible: Track configuration, versions, provenance and command
  lines to enable debugging, extension and reproducibility of results.

- Community developed: The development process is fully open and
  sustained by contributors from multiple institutions. By working
  together on a shared framework, we can overcome the challenges
  associated with maintaining complex pipelines in a rapidly changing
  area of research.

- Accessible: Bioinformaticians, biologists and the general public
  should be able to run these tools on inputs ranging from research
  materials to clinical samples to personal genomes.

A sample of institutions using bcbio-nextgen for solving biological
problems. Please submit your story if you're using the pipeline in
your own research.

- `Harvard School of Public Health`_: We use bcbio-nextgen within the
  bioinformatics core for variant calling on large population studies
  related to human health like Breast Cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
  Increasing scalability of the pipeline has been essential for
  handling study sizes of more than 1400 whole genomes.

- `Massachusetts General Hospital`_: The Department of Molecular
  Biology uses the pipeline to automatically process samples coming
  off Illumina HiSeq instruments. Automated pipelines perform
  alignment and sample-specific analysis, with results directly
  uploaded into a local `Galaxy`_ instance.

- `Science for Life Laboratory`_: The genomics core platform in
  the Swedish National Infrastructure (`NGI`_) for genomics, has crunched
  over 16TBp (terabasepairs) and processed almost 7000+ samples
  from the beginning of 2013 until the end of July. `UPPMAX`_, our
  cluster located in Uppsala runs the pipeline in production since 2010.

- `Institute of Human Genetics, UCSF`_: The Genomics Core Facility
  utilizes bcbio-nextgen in processing more than 2000 whole genome,
  exome, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq on various projects. This pipeline
  tremendously lowers the barrier of getting access to next generation
  sequencing technology. The community engaged here is also very
  helpful in providing best practices advices and up-to-date solution
  to ease scientific discovery.

- `IRCCS "Mario Negri" Institute for Pharmacological Research`_:
  The Translational Genomics Unit in the Department of Oncology uses
  bcbio-nextgen for targeted resequencing (using an Illumina MiSeq) to
  identify mutations and other variants in tumor samples to
  investigate their link to tumor progression, patient survival and
  drug sensitivity and resistance. A
  `poster from the 2014 European Society of Human Genetics meeting`_
  provides more details on usage in ovarian cancer. A paper on the study of
  longitudinal ovarian cancer biopsies, which makes extensive use
  of bcbio-nextgen, `was published in 2015 in Annals of Oncology`_.

- `The Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen)`_:
  Members of the `Huentelman lab`_ at TGen apply bcbio-nextgen to a wide
  variety of studies of with a major focus in the neurobiology of aging
  and neurodegeneration in collaboration with the The Arizona Alzheimer's Consortium (`AAC`_)
  and  the `McKnight Brain Research Foundation`_.
  We also use bcbio in studies of rare diseases in children through TGen's
  Center for Rare Childhood Disorders (`C4RCD`_),  and other rare diseases such as
  Multiple System Atrophy (`MSA`_). bcbio-nextgen has also been instrumental in
  projects for TGen's Program for Canine Health & Performance (`PCHP`_)
  and numerous RNA-seq projects using rodent models. Our work with bcbio
  started with a parnership with `Dell` and The Neuroblastoma and
  Medulloblastoma Translational Research Consortium (`NMTRC`_),
  and TGen as part of a Phase I clinical trial in these rare childhood cancers.

- `Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), MIT`_:
  The `Gifford lab`_ uses the bcbio-nextgen pipeline to analyze
  a variety of sequencing datasets for their research in genetics and
  regulatory genomics (including the `SysCode`_ and
  `stemcell.mit.edu`_ projects).  The pipeline applies
  collaboratively-developed best practices for analysis as well as
  computation, which enables the lab to run the pipeline on local
  clusters and Amazon EC2.

- `Sheffield Bioinformatics Core, The University of Sheffield`_: The Sheffield Bioinformatics Core is a relatively new Core facility at The University of Sheffield, and bcbio has been instrumental in setting-up a best-practice Bioinformatics analysis service. We employ bcbio to automate the analyses of RNA-seq, small RNA and ChiP-Seq datasets for researchers at The University of Sheffield and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre. In conjunction with the bcbioRNASeq Bioconductor package, we deliver publication-quality reports to our researchers based on reproducible analyses.
