## Outputs

bcbio-nextgen runs in a temporary work directory which contains a number of processing intermediates. Pipeline completion extracts the final useful output files into a separate directory, specified by the [Upload](contents/configuration:upload). This configuration allows upload to local directories, Galaxy, or Amazon S3. Once extracting and confirming the output files, you can delete the temporary directory to save space.

### Common files

The output directory contains sample specific output files labeled by sample name and a more general project directory. The sample directories contain all of the sample specific output files, while the project directory contains global files like project summaries or batched population level variant calls. See the [Teaching](teaching) documentation for a full variant calling example with additional details about configuration setting and resulting output files.

Project directory:
* `project-summary.yaml` -- Top level YAML format summary file with statistics on read alignments and duplications as well as analysis specific metrics.
* `programs.txt` -- Program versions for bcbio-nextgen and software run in the pipeline. This enables reproduction of analyses.
* `multiqc` run [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) to gather all QC metrics from different tools, such as, cutadapt, featureCounts, samtools, STAR .. into an unique HTML report.
* `metadata.csv` -- CSV with the metadata in the YAML file.
* `data_versions.csv` -- Data versions for bcbio-nextgen and software

Sample directories:
* `SAMPLE/qc` -- Directory of quality control runs for the sample. These include charts and metrics for assessing quality of sequencing and analysis.
* `SAMPLE-ready.bam` -- A prepared BAM file of the aligned reads. Depending on the analysis used, this may include trimmed, recalibrated and realigned reads following alignment.

### Variant calling

Project directory:
* `grading-summary.csv` -- Grading details comparing each sample to a reference set of calls. This will only have information when providing a validation callset.
* `BATCH-caller.vcf` -- Variants called for a population/batch of samples by a particular caller.
* `BATCH-caller.db` -- A [GEMINI database](https://github.com/arq5x/gemini) associating variant calls with a wide variety of third party annotations. This provides a queryable framework for assessing variant quality statistics.

Sample directories:
* `SAMPLE-caller.vcf` -- Variants calls for an individual sample.
* `SAMPLE-gdc-viral-completeness.txt` -- Optional viral contamination estimates. File is of the format **depth, 1x, 5x, 25x**. **depth** is the number of reads aligning to the virus. **1x, 5x, 25x** are percentage of the viral sequence covered by reads of 1x, 5x, 25x depth. Real viral contamination will have broad coverage across the entire genome, so high numbers for these values, depending on sequencing depth. High depth and low viral sequence coverage means a likely false positive.

Workflow for analysis:

For gene-level analyses, we recommend loading the gene-level counts.csv.gz and the metadata.csv.gz and using [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) to do the analysis. For a more in-depth walkthrough of how to use DESeq2, refer to our [DGE_workshop](https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop_salmon/schedule/).

For transcript-level analyses, we recommend using [sleuth](http://seqcluster.readthedocs.io/mirna_annotation.html) with the bootstrap samples. You can load the abundance.h5 files from Salmon, or if you set `kallisto` as an expression caller, use the abundance.h5 files from that.

Another great alternative is to use the Salmon quantification to look at differential transcript usage (DTU) instead of differential transcript expression (DTE). The idea behind DTU is you are looking for transcripts of genes that have been flipped from one isoform to another. The [Swimming downstream](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/workflows/vignettes/rnaseqDTU/inst/doc/rnaseqDTU.html#salmon-quantification) tutorial has a nice walkthrough of how to do that.

### single cell RNA-Seq

Project directory:
* `tagcounts.mtx` -- count matrix compatible with dgCMatrix type in R.
* `tagcounts-dupes.mtx` -- count matrix compatible with dgCMatrix type in R but with the duplicated reads counted.
* `tagcounts.mtx.colnames` -- cell names that would be the columns for the matrix.
* `tagcounts.mtx.rownames` -- gene names that would be the rows for the matrix.
* `tagcounts.mtx.metadata` -- metadata that match the colnames for the matrix. This is coming from the barcode.csv file and the metadata given in the YAML config file. for the matrix.
* `cb-histogram.txt` -- total number of dedup reads assigned to a cell. Comparing colSums(tagcounts.mtx) to this number can tell you how many reads mapped to genes.

in bash:
```shell
mkdir data
