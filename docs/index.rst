A python toolkit providing best-practice pipelines for fully automated
high throughput sequencing analysis. You write a high level
configuration file specifying your inputs and analysis parameters.
This input drives a parallel pipeline that handles distributed
execution, idempotent processing restarts and safe transactional
steps. The goal is to provide a shared community resource that handles
the data processing component of sequencing analysis, providing
researchers with more time to focus on the downstream biology.
