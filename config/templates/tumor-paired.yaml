# Template for paired (tumor/normal) variant calling

details:
  - analysis: variant2
    genome_build: GRCh37
    # In order to do paired variant calling, samples should belong to the
    # same batch ("batch" under "metadata" below") and have a "phenotype"
    # field stating either "normal" or tumor". For each batch there
    # should be a sample with "tumor" phenotype and a sample with "normal"
    # phenotype (no more than two samples per batch)
    metadata:
       batch: your-batch-name
       phenotype: tumor # or "normal"
