# Template for mouse chip-seq using Illumina prepared samples
---
details:
- analysis: chip-seq
  # In order to do paired peak calling, samples should belong to the
  # same batch ("batch" under "metadata" below") and have a "phenotype"
  # field stating either "input" or chip". For each batch there
  # should be a sample with "chip" phenotype and a sample with "input"
  # phenotype (no more than two samples per batch)
  metadata:
     batch: your-batch-name
     phenotype: chip # or input
