# Configuration file specifying system details for running an analysis pipeline
# These pipeline apply generally across multiple projects. Adjust them in sample
# specific configuration files when needed.

# -- Base setup

# Define resources to be used for individual programs on multicore machines.
# These can be defined specifically for memory and processor availability.
# - memory: Specify usage for memory intensive programs. The indicated value
#           specifies the wanted *per core* usage.
# - cores: Define cores that can be used for multicore programs. The indicated
#          value is the maximum cores that should be allocated for a program.
# - jvm_opts: specify details
# - cmd: Command to launch the program, if not located on PATH.
# - dir: Directory containing program associated data. Especially useful for
#        java jars
resources:
  # default options, used if other items below are not present
  # avoids needing to configure/adjust for every program
