# Configuration file specifying system details for running an analysis pipeline
# These pipeline apply generally across multiple projects. Adjust them in sample
# specific configuration files when needed.

# -- Base setup

# Define resources to be used for individual programs on multicore machines.
# These can be defined specifically for memory and processor availability.
# - memory: Specify usage for memory intensive programs. The indicated value
#           specifies the wanted *per core* usage.
# - cores: Define cores that can be used for multicore programs. The indicated
#          value is the maximum cores that should be allocated for a program.
# - jvm_opts: specify details
resources:
  # default options, used if other items below are not present
  # avoids needing to configure/adjust for every program
  default:
    memory: 3G
    cores: 16
    jvm_opts: ["-Xms750m", "-Xmx3500m"]
  # Can also set program specific options
  # gatk:
  #   jvm_opts: ["-Xms500m", "-Xmx3500m"]
  snpeff:
    jvm_opts: ["-Xms750m", "-Xmx3g"]
  qualimap:
    memory: 4g
  express:
    memory: 8g
  dexseq:
    memory: 10g
  macs2:
    memory: 8g
